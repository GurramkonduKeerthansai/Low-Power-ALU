# Low-Power-ALU
Designed a low-power ALU using Cadence and LTspice, utilizing both semi-custom and full-custom flows. Power optimization techniques, including transistor count reduction were implemented. Logic styles such as PTL, dynamic logic, and CMOS were applied to enhance efficiency. Post-layout simulations confirmed significant power reduction and performance improvements.
